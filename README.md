## 🧠 What is Data Engineering?

**Definition:**  
Data Engineering is the field focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of systems that collect, store, transform, and move data so it can be used for analysis, reporting, and machine learning.

### 🏗️ Why is it Important?
- Ensures data is **clean**, **available**, **reliable**, and **accessible**
- Empowers **Data Scientists**, **Analysts**, and **Business Teams**

### 📦 Responsibilities:
- Build data pipelines
- Clean and transform raw data
- Manage storage systems (e.g. warehouses)
- Integrate data from multiple sources
- Monitor data quality and performance

## 🧊 Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse

### 🏢 Data Warehouse
- Structured, clean data
- Optimized for analytics
- SQL support
- Examples: **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, **Redshift**

### 🌊 Data Lake
- Stores raw/unstructured/structured data
- Flexible, scalable, cheap
- Examples: **Amazon S3**, **Azure Data Lake**

### 🏠💧 Data Lakehouse
- Combines features of both
- Structured + unstructured support
- SQL performance + flexibility
- Examples: **Databricks Lakehouse**, **Delta Lake**
